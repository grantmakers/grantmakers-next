### ~~HeadlessUI~~ Tailwind Elements

The project is transitioning from using a svelte-focused wrapper of HeadlessUI, to the new cross-platform version of HeadlessUI called Elements, also from the Tailwind Labs team.

Note: A commercial license is required to use Tailwind Plus Elements

The project may have legacy implementations of [`svelte-headlessui`](https://captaincodeman.github.io/svelte-headlessui/) which is heavily inspired by the [`Tailwind HeadlessUI`](https://headlessui.com/) project. These will be refactored out in favor of Tailwind Elements over time.

    <p class="mt-6">I'm the creator of Grantmakers.io.</p>
    <p class="mt-6">
      I launched the project in 2016 with a simple belief: <span class="font-semibold text-slate-900"
        >grants data should be available to every nonprofit</span
      >, not just those with big budgets. I am completely rebuilding the platform in 2025 because I continue to see how unfettered access to
      good data helps organizations make a deeper impact in their communities.

    <p class="mt-6 rounded-lg bg-blue-100 p-6">
      Every week, 8,000 users visit Grantmakers.io to conduct their foundation and grant searches. No login required. No limits.

        A contribution to Grantmakers.io means you believe in open data. It means you support new models for ensuring grants data remains
        free and open for everyone, regardless of one's ability to afford expensive subscription-based databases.

      The best way to get to know Grantmakers.io is to first understand the public dataset from which the site is derived.

    <p class="mt-12">
      The IRS started publishing foundation tax returns in "machine-readable format" for the first time in 2016. Grantmakers.io pulls data
      exclusively from this dataset. It's open...it's free...it's awesome.

      <p class="mt-6">
        Grantmakers.io focuses exclusively on Form 990-PF, the tax filing used by private foundations. If a foundation files a different tax
        form, they will not be included in search results and will not have a profile on Grantmakers.io. For example, community foundations
        and operating foundations file Form 990 (not Form 990-PF), so they will not appear on Grantmakers.io.

        Great for quick research and initial prospecting
      </h2>
      <p class="mt-6">
        Grantmakers.io was originally built to help a friend find information on a specific funding prospect previously identified. Profiles
        Search was the first search tool created and is optimized to quickly find a funder's profile (if one exists).
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        The Grants Search tool was developed to allow fundraisers to do basic prospecting by exploring which foundations have donated to
        similar grantees in the past.
      </p>

      <h2 id="toc-updates" class="mt-16 text-pretty text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-gray-900">
        IRS controls the frequency of updates
      </h2>
      <p class="mt-6">
        The IRS publishes updates on a roughly monthly cadence. Grantmakers.io, in turn, uses automated scripts to fetch, parse, and publish
        these updates. Updates are typically live on Grantmakers.io within a week of being published by the IRS.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        When using the Grant Search tool for basic prospecting, be mindful of the delay from the time a foundation makes a grant to the time
        it makes its way through the tax filing and IRS publication process. "New" grants that appear in Grant Search results were likely
        actually funded 9-18+ months before first appearing in results.
      </p>

      <h2 id="toc-quirks" class="mt-16 text-pretty text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-gray-900">Foundations control the content</h2>
      <p class="mt-6">
        The information a foundation enters when filing their return appears exactly as entered on the return. Most of the time foundations
        catch misspellings and mistakes before filing their returns, but don't be surprised if you come across the occasional piece of data
        that simply looks odd.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        You can certainly reach out to the foundation to give them a heads up on any errors you find, but the only way a foundation can
        adjust their filing content is to file a full amendment to their return. This might come at significant expense. For this reason,
        Grantmakers.io has a "Community Intelligence" section on each profile to provide context behind suggested edits and adjustments.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6">
        Another thing to keep in mind is grantee names can be whatever the foundation wants to list. There is no IRS requirement to use the
        actual legal name for the grantees, and no requirement to distinguish between national HQ recipients and their local/regional
        organizations. Be sure to use the filter tools to select the names most relevant to your search, and be mindful that misspellings do
        indeed exist.
